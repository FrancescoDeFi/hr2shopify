Hr² feels more like a long-term decision that helps me with ingredients specifically designed to promote hair growth.

It gives me the feeling of being in control of my hair health instead of just watching.",

I feel nourished and don't have to worry about it anymore. By now, it's part of my morning routine, and I finally feel like I'm doing something meaningful for myself instead of just hoping things get better.",
      "quote_3": "I work and train hard. The effort and stress that come with it have their downsides too. At some point, I realized I had completely neglected an important aspect: my hair. Since taking Hr², I've finally overcome that uncomfortable feeling of looking at the floor after a shower and wanting to count my fallen hairs."

      "a1": "Hr² is a daily nutrient boost with over 70 high-quality ingredients – including vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and bacterial cultures. Developed by experts, science-backed, and recommended by high performers worldwide, Hr² makes it easy to support body and mind every day. Learn more {{ link }}.",
      "q2": "Does Hr² work for my hair type?",
      "a2": "Hr² is designed for daily, long-term hair health support – regardless of hair type or texture. Since the causes of hair loss and thinning vary (e.g., nutrient status, stress, hormones, genetic factors), results may vary individually.",
      "q3": "Does it work for both women and men?",
      "a3": "Yes. Hr² is designed for both women and men and supports hair health regardless of gender. Since causes and starting points (e.g., nutrient status, stress, hormones, genetics) are individual, results may vary.",
      "q4": "Does Hr² contain medicinal drugs?",
      "a4": "No. Hr² is a food supplement and contains no medicinal drugs. It provides selected ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, plant extracts, and amino acids for daily support.",
      "q5": "I know some hair growth treatments have side effects. Does that apply to Hr² as well?",
      "a5": "As a food supplement, Hr² is generally well tolerated. As with all supplements, individual intolerances may occur (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort). If you experience any issues, pause use and consult a doctor – especially if you have pre-existing conditions, are pregnant/breastfeeding, or are taking medication.",
      "q6": "Is there a risk that Hr² lowers libido?",
      "a6": "Hr² contains no medicinal drugs and is not intended to interfere with hormones. Individual reactions are still possible – if you notice changes, pause use and consult a medical professional.",
      "q7": "Does Hr² cause unwanted hair growth on other body parts?",
      "a7": "Hr² is designed to support overall nutrient supply and hair health – not to specifically promote body hair. Since hair growth is biologically complex, individual effects may vary.",
      "q8": "Is Hr² certified by independent third parties?",
      "a8": "We place great value on quality assurance and test both raw materials and finished products as part of our quality controls. If you need specific certifications or test documents, please contact our support team.",
      "q9": "Is Hr² approved by the EMA?",
      "a9": "Hr² is a food supplement. Food supplements are generally not 'approved' by the EMA like pharmaceutical drugs. Classification and requirements depend on the respective market and applicable regulatory standards.",
      "q10": "Can I take Hr² together with other hair support products and supplements?",
      "a10": "Generally yes, but watch out for double dosages (e.g., zinc, biotin, or other micronutrients) and the recommended daily amount. If you're taking medication or have health concerns, it's best to discuss the combination with your doctor or pharmacist.",
      "q11": "Does Hr² help with genetic hair thinning?",
      "a11": "Genetics often play a major role in hair thinning. Hr² can support nutrient supply and hair health, but does not replace medical diagnosis or therapy. If you notice significant or increasing hair thinning, a consultation with a dermatologist is recommended."
