        Elevo Health Limited (Hr²).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Contract formation</h2>
      <p>
        Product presentation on this website does not constitute a legally binding offer, but a non-binding overview.
        A contract is concluded once we confirm your order or dispatch the goods.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Prices &amp; payment</h2>
      <p>
        All prices include applicable statutory VAT (where applicable) plus shipping costs where shown.
        Available payment methods are displayed during checkout.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery times and shipping costs are shown during the order process. Partial deliveries are permissible
        where reasonable for you.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Withdrawal</h2>
      <p>
        Consumers generally have a right of withdrawal. Details are available on the
        <a href="{{ pages['widerruf'].url | default: '/pages/widerruf' }}">Right of Withdrawal</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        Statutory warranty rights apply.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        We are fully liable for intent and gross negligence. For slight negligence, we are only liable for breaches
        of essential contractual obligations and limited to foreseeable, typical damages. Mandatory statutory liability
        provisions remain unaffected.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Final provisions</h2>
      <p>
        The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International
        Sale of Goods (CISG), unless mandatory consumer protection law provides otherwise.
